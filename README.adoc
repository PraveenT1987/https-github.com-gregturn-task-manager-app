This code is another demo of how Spring Data REST can massively simplify code.

The original project had a simple domain object. Then it created a customer Spring MVC controller to create RESTful CRUD ops. Backing the controller was a service layer
that used raw JDBC code to perform various CRUD ops to a persistent data store.

Issues:

* No build file.
* Raw JDBC. I haven't seen this since 2006. JdbcTemplate is an awesome tool that lets you only write SQL while letting Spring handle connection management. But in this day and age
you can simply jump to http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA].
* Hand written Spring MVC RESTful endpoints. No biggie, except we now have http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest[Spring Data REST], a library that automatically exports your 
domain objects with a RESTful, hypermedia-drive interface.
* XML-based Spring config and servlet context

I basically threw out the controller, the DAO, and the connection creation library. I edited the domain POJO so that field names matched the getters/setters. (Spring Data couldn't 
handle such a deviation). No more need for a connection creation library. I then created a `TaskRepository` interface and added a few custom finders. From there, I was able to
focus all my effort on fixing the Angular front end to talk to the right endpoints. Even though I didn't know a thing about Angular, I was able to fix things up and get the
app working again.

I create a maven build file, so it's quick and easy to run.

== To run in "dev" mode

This runs things in a local "dev" mode by using the in-memory H2 database.

From the command-line:

----
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run
...
----

Build a runnable JAR
----
$ mvn clean package
$ java -jar target/spring-and-angular-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
...
----

Or from your IDE, run `Application.main`.

From there, navigate to http://localhost:8080/home.

== To run in "production" mode

NOTE: This runs things in a local "dev" mode by using the in-memory H2 database.

From the command line:
----
$ SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production mvn spring-boot:run
----

You can also build and run as an executable JAR file:

----
$ mvn package
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=production target/spring-and-angular-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

WARNING: `-Dspring.profiles.active=production` does NOT work when running `mvn spring-boot:run`.


New Issues:

* The front end has a habit of posting to the back end, and then fetching ALL data to re-populate the UI. It would be less taxing and more scaleable if it simply grabbed the
**Location** header when creating a new item, GET that, and add it to the list.
* Unfamiliar with Angular's promises. In the step where I do a patch to update `taskArchived` to true, I use a JavaScript forEach statement then re-fetch all the tasks. It would be
best to wait until ALL tasks are updated to do that. https://github.com/cujojs/when[when.js] is great resource for this.
